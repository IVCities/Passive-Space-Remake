# Passive-Space-Remake
Taipei City, the capital of Taiwan, is the congestion of domestic companies, work opportunities, urban activities, and urban life. Like many other capital cities, Taipei’s living cost is higher than average of the nation, including the affordability of owning a piece of space.  However, given the city’s rather long history of development, Taipei’s urban fabric has grown organically and complex, accompanied with modern issues like aging buildings, tangled or unclear land and property ownerships, etc.  If you happened to have lived in Taipei, you might find that, on one hand, it’s luxurious and costly to own a space in the city, while on the other hand, many of its urban space were, in fact, underutilized or passively used. These seemly contradicting facts made us wonder: are the urban space in their best use? where are space that need improvement? and how might we better use them?
